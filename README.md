<i>Based on a course book "Português para principiantes" by Galina Petrova and João Carlos Mendonça João</i>
  
<b>Purpose</b>

This app is meant to help students learn new words even when they're on the go and do not have a printed version of the course book at hand.

<b>Principle</b>

The principle is rather simple and intuitive:
1. Look at a new word-translation pair and try to memorize it
2. Try to remember the translation and if you guessed it correctly, swipe right (or use a button). If not - swipe left.
3. After remembering a word correctly 5 times the word will be categorized as "learned" and your progress will grow

<b>Modes</b>

You can choose between two learning modes: by topics (if you want to learn words as they come in the course) or all words in general (for example, if you want to revise all words for the exam). What's more, after you've covered all topics, you'll be prompted to revise all words altogether or reset the progress.
